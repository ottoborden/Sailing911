        <h4>THE BEGINNING...</h4>

        <p>We started humbly but with a grand plan: To create the finest website in the world offering the sailing community access to all aspects of the sailing industry. And the cost to the user...not a dime. From boats to hardware, sails and cleaning supplies, you name it, we cover it all. Through this dream, we've grown. Today, we have become one of the most frequently visited website for Sail Boats, Supplies, Accessories, Supplies and more.</p>

        <p>Our secret? Admittedly, it is not one. As with any sailor, like you, it is simply our unrelenting love for sailing.</p>

        <p>As for our name. "Sailing911.com." Simple enough. Sailing is simply sailing and 911 simply means help. Thus...help for all involved in sailing. Simple enough.</p>

        <p>While we try to cover all topics, rest assured we are always open for any useful suggestions. Feel free to share your thoughts with us at anytime via email, mail or phone. Contact Us page is above.</p>

        <p>Please enjoy the site.</p>

        <p>On behalf of all of us at "Sailing911.com" thank you for visiting!</p>
